# This is being updated by us... (a little)

Since we still use Sinatra, we are hoping to extend this bundle a little.

Sinatra.tmbundle
================

Oooh, shiny! The kickass [Sinatra][] TextMate bundle.

[Sinatra]: http://sinatrarb.com

Notes
-----

The Ruby (Sinatra) language bundle attempts to color some of the DSL.
The snippets are set for `source.ruby` so they can be used without using the language bundle.
[OB][http://obdev.co.uk] Have added support for the DSL (get|put|post|delete|configure|before)

Installation
------------

    git clone git://github.com/osbornebrook/sinatra-tmbundle ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/Sinatra.tmbundle
